- 👋 Hi, I’m Stephen
- 👀 I’m interested in Python Development and DevOps technologies.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the Docker platform and how to use APIs. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that would further my abilities as a DevOps engineer. I admit I have alot to learn, but I am a fast learner and
      I am developing a love and appreciation for the DevOps role.
